Technology Used : Java and JavaFx (For UI)

Classes:
Enigma Controller
Enigma Basic
Enigma Advance (Currently Deprecated)
Keyboard
PlugBoard
Reflector
Rotor

How code Works:


1. To encrypt a data we first get the text to be encrypt than few parameters like which 3 rotors to be used, rotor rings, rotor key, And few pair of characters for plugboard. The use of all these thing will get cleared as we move forward.
2. On the basis of user data we create 3 instances of rotors,a plugboard and a reflector.
  ->In rotor ,we have 2 sequence of character ,left and right.In left Sequence we have stored the normal sequence A-Z, 
    for right we have special sequences .
  ->


3.Now the encryption start!!
